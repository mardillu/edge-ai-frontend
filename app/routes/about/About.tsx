        About Edge AI
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        This project explores the development of an innovative Edge AI solution aimed at bridging the
        technology gap in rural Africa, a region often constrained by language barriers and limited
        internet connectivity. We propose a system that leverages Unstructured Supplementary
        Service Data (USSD) and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) services, allowing users to engage
        with advanced AI technologies using simple mobile devices and their local languages.
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        As part of our research preview, we have also designed this simulator for users who are
        unable to utilize the USSD service. This simulator replicates the experience of a basic phone,
        providing an interactive platform for users to familiarize themselves with the USSD interface.
        By offering this research preview, we seek to gather valuable feedback and insights from users
        to refine and improve our Edge AI solution. Through this endeavor, we aim to enable more
        individuals to access and benefit from our AI-driven services, representing a significant
        stride towards utilizing AI for social and economic development in resource-constrained settings
        while ensuring inclusivity and participation in the digital age.

        How it works
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        If you are familiar with USSD codes and comfortable with using feature phones, this should be a breeze.
      </Typography>
      <ol>
        <li>Click here to navigate to the simulator</li>
        <li>A test phone number will be assigned to you</li>
        <li>Dial the USSD code *920*223#</li>
        <li>Click on the call button and wait for the prompt</li>
        <li>Type any prompt <b>in your local language</b></li>
        <li>Read the disclaimer</li>
